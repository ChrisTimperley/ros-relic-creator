# ros-relic-creator


## Usage

* Requires Python 3.6 or greater.
* Requires a GitHub API access token to be located at `github.token` within the
  working directory.

For now, you can run some example code by simply executing the script.

Note that the script can take a couple of minutes to run for larger repositories.
The number of GitHub API requests is linear in terms of the number of tagged
releases for a given repository.
